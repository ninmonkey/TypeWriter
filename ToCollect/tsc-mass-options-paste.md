Running tsc locally will compile the closest project defined by a tsconfig.json, or you can compile a set of TypeScript files by passing in a glob of files you want. When input files are specified on the command line, tsconfig.json files are ignored.

# Run a compile based on a backwards look through the fs for a tsconfig.json
tsc
# Emit JS for just the index.ts with the compiler defaults
tsc index.ts
# Emit JS for any .ts files in the folder src, with the default settings
tsc src/*.ts
# Emit files referenced in with the compiler settings from tsconfig.production.json
tsc --project tsconfig.production.json
# Emit d.ts files for a js file with showing compiler options which are booleans
tsc index.js --declaration --emitDeclarationOnly
# Emit a single .js file from two files via compiler options which take string arguments
tsc app.ts util.ts --target esnext --outfile index.js
